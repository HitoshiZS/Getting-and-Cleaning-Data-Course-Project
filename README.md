# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

# Project Description
## Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Getting Started
## 1. Download the zip file from the data source and unzip into a folder on your drive. You'll see a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
## 2. Save run_analysis.R into the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset and set that location as the working directory in RStudio.
## 3. Run source(run_analysis.R), which will create final_data.txt in your working directory.
